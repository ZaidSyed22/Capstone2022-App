This app was created for people who invest (or hope to invest) in real estate but may not necessarily know the calcalutions that one needs to succeed in real estate. If you already know those numbers, you can compare your assumptions with ours!

   - Once the submit button is pressed our app with give you the calculations for the cash flow, net present value & sale price for the property. You can also see the location in the map and the assumtions we made for the financials for the building

## Here are some terms that may be useful from Investopedia:

- SF: sqaure foot

- NOI: NOI is a before-tax figure, appearing on a property’s income and cash flow statement, that excludes principal and interest payments on loans, capital expenditures, depreciation, and amortization. When this metric is used in other industries, it is referred to as “EBIT,” which stands for “earnings before interest and taxes.”

- Capitalization Rate(AKA Cap Rate):This measure is computed based on the net income which the property is expected to generate and is calculated by dividing net operating income by property asset value and is expressed as a percentage. It is used to estimate the investor's potential return on their investment in the real estate market.
